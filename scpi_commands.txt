Chapter 3  
SCPI Commands 
This chapter explains in detail the SCPI commands used by the electronic load.  The electronic load 
conforms to SCPI Version 1995.0. 
 
 
 
3.1 Language Dictionary 
This section describes the syntax and parameters for all the IEEE 488.2 SCPI subsystem and common 
commands used by the electronic loads. Since the SCPI syntax remains the same for all programming 
languages, the examples given for each command are generic. 
 
Syntax Forms 
Syntax definitions use the long form, but only short form headers (or 
"keywords") appear in the examples. Use the long form to help make your 
program self-documenting. 
Parameters 
Most commands require a parameter and all queries will return a parameter. 
The range for a parameter may vary according to the model of electronic 
load. Parameters for all models are listed in the Specifications table in the 
User’s Guide. 
Related Commands 
Where appropriate, related commands or queries are included. These are 
listed because they are either directly related by function, or because reading 
about them will clarify or enhance your understanding of the original 
command or query. 
Order of Presentation 
 
The dictionary is organized as follows: 
 Subsystem commands, arranged by subsystem 
 IEEE 488.2 common commands 
 
 
Common Commands 
Common commands begin with an * and consist of three letters (command) or three letters and a ? 
(query). They are defined by the IEEE 488.2 standard to perform common interface functions. Common 
commands and queries are categorized under System, Status, or Trigger functions and are listed at the 
end of this chapter. 
 
 
Subsystem Commands 
Subsystem commands are specific to functions. They can be a single command or a group of 


---- PAGE 27 ----
27 
commands. The groups are comprised of commands that extend one or more levels below the root. 
 
The subsystem command groups are arranged according to function: Calibration, Input, List, 
Measurement, Port, Status, System, Transient, and Trigger. Commands under each function are 
grouped alphabetically under the subsystem. Commands followed by a question mark (?) take only the 
query form. When commands take both the command and query form, this is noted in the syntax 
descriptions.  
 
 
 
3.2 Common Commands 
Common commands begin with an * and consist of three letters (command) IEEE 488.2 standard to 
perform some common interface functions. The electronic loads respond to the required common 
commands that control status reporting, synchronization, and internal operations. The electronic loads 
also respond to optional common commands that control triggers, power-on conditions, and stored 
operating parameters. 
 
Common commands and queries are listed alphabetically. If a command has a corresponding query 
that simply returns the data or status specified by the command, then both command and query are 
included under the explanation for the command. If a query does not have a corresponding command 
or is functionally different from the command, then the query is listed separately. The description for 
each common command or query specifies any status registers affected. Refer to 1.4 Programming the 
Status Registers, which explains how to read specific register bits and use the information that they 
return.

*ESE <NRf> — Event Enable 
This command programs the Standard Event Status Enable register bits. The programming determines 
which events of the Standard Event Status Event Register (see *ESR?) are allowed to set the ESB (Event 
Summary Bit) of the Status Byte register. A "1" in the bit position enables the corresponding event. All 
of the enabled events of the Standard Event Status Event register are logically ORed to cause the Event 
Summary Bit (ESB) of the Status Byte Register to be set. See 1.4 Programming the Status Registers for 
descriptions of the Standard Event Status registers. The query reads the Standard Event Status Enable 
register.

*OPC 
This command causes the interface to set the OPC bit (bit 0) of the Standard Event Status register 
when the electronic load has completed all pending operations. (See *ESE command for the bit 
configuration of the Standard Event Status registers.) Pending operations are complete when: 
 
 All commands sent before *OPC have been executed. This includes overlapped commands. 
Most commands are sequential and are completed before the next command is executed. 
Overlapped commands are executed in parallel with other commands. Commands that 
affect trigger actions are overlapped with subsequent commands sent to the electronic 
load. The *OPC command provides notification that all overlapped commands have been 
completed. 
 All triggered actions are completed and the trigger system returns to the Idle state. 
 
*OPC does not prevent processing of subsequent commands but bit 0 will not be set until all pending 
operations are completed. The query causes the interface to place an ASCII "1" in the Output Queue 
when all pending operations are completed.

Returned Parameters <NR1> 
Related Commands *TRIG *WAI 
 
 
*RCL 
This command restores the electronic load to a state that was previously stored in memory with a 
*SAV command to the specified location. All states are recalled with the following exceptions: 
 CAL:STATe is set to OFF 
 The trigger system is set to the Idle state by an implied ABORt command (this cancels any 
incomplete trigger actions) 
 
NOTE: The device state stored in location 0 is automatically recalled at power turn-on.

*SAV 
This command stores the present state of the electronic load to a specified location in memory. Up to 
101 states can be stored. 
 
If a particular state is desired at power-on, it should be stored in location 0. It will then be recalled at 
power-on if the power-on state is set to RCL0. Use *RCL to retrieve instrument states. 
 
Command Syntax *SAV <NRf> 
Parameters 0 to 100 
Example *SAV 3 
Related Commands *PSC *RST *RCL 
 
*SRE 
This command sets the condition of the Service Request Enable register. This register determines 
which bits from the Status Byte Register (see *STB for its bit configuration) are allowed to set the 
Master Status Summary (MSS) bit and the Request for Service (RQS) summary bit. A 1 in any Service 
Request Enable register bit position enables the corresponding Status Byte register bit and all such 
enabled bits are then logically ORed to cause Bit 6 of the Status Byte Register to be set. 
 
When the controller conducts a serial poll in response to SRQ, the RQS bit is cleared, but the MSS bit is 
not. When *SRE is cleared (by programming it with 0), the electronic load cannot generate an SRQ to 
the controller. The query returns the current state of *SRE. 
Command Syntax *SRE <NRf> 
Parameters 0 to 255 
Default Value See *PSC 
Example *SRE 128 
Query Syntax *SRE? 
Returned Parameters <NR1> (register binary value) 
Related Commands *ESE *ESR *PSC 
*STB? 
This query reads the Status Byte register, which contains the status summary bits and the Output 
Queue MAV bit. Reading the Status Byte register does not clear it. The input summary bits are cleared 
when the appropriate event registers are read (see 1.4 Programming the Status Registers for more 
information). A serial poll also returns the value of the Status Byte register, except that bit 6 returns 
Request for Service (RQS) instead of Master Status Summary (MSS). A serial poll clears RQS, but not 
MSS. When MSS is set, it indicates that the electronic load has one or more reasons for requesting 
service. 
 
Query Syntax *STB? 
Parameters None 
Returned Parameters <NR1> (register value)

Related Commands *SRE *ESR *ESE 
 
 
*TRG 
This command generates a trigger to any system that has BUS selected as its source (for example, 
TRIG:SOUR BUS). The command has the same effect as the Group Execute Trigger (<GET>) command. 
 
Command Syntax *TRG 
Parameters None 
Related Commands ABOR INIT   TRIG:IMM 
 
*TST? 
This query causes the electronic load to do a self-test and report any errors. 
 
Query Syntax TST? 
 
Parameters None 
 
Related Commands <NR1> 
0 indicates the electronic load has passed self-
test. Non-zero indicates an error code. 
*WAI 
This command instructs the electronic load not to process any further commands until all pending 
operations are completed. Pending operations are complete when: 
 
 All commands sent before *WAI have been executed. This includes overlapped commands. 
Most commands are sequential and are completed before the next command is executed. 
Overlapped commands are executed in parallel with other commands. Commands that affect 
input voltage or state, relays, and trigger actions are overlapped with subsequent commands 
sent to the electronic load. The *WAI command prevents subsequent commands from being 
executed before any overlapped commands have been completed. 
 All triggered actions are completed and the trigger system returns to the Idle state.  
 
*WAI can be aborted only by sending the electronic load a GPIB DCL (Device Clear) command. 
 
Command Syntax WAI? 
Parameters None 
Related Commands *OPC

Trigger Commands 
The trigger subsystem is made up of a series of commands and subsystems to configure the trigger 
model. 
 
 
TRIGger:SOURce 
This command selects the trigger source.  


---- PAGE 35 ----
35 
BUS 
Accepts a GPIB <GET> signal or a *TRG command as the trigger source. This 
selection guarantees that all previous commands are complete before the trigger 
occurs. 
EXTernal 
Selects the electronic load’s trigger input as the trigger source. This trigger is 
processed as soon as it is received. 
HOLD 
Only the TRIG:IMM command will generate a trigger in HOLD mode. All other 
trigger commands are ignored. 
MANUal 
The event occurs when the Trig key is pressed. 
TIMer 
This generates triggers that are in synchronization with the electronic load's 
internal oscillator as the trigger source. The internal oscillator begins running as 
soon as this command is executed. Use TRIG:TIM to program the oscillator period.

Examples SYST:VERS? 
Returned Parameters <NR2> 
 
 
SYSTem:ERRor? 
This query returns the next error number followed by its corresponding error message string from the 
remote programming error queue. The queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) buffer that stores errors as 
they occur. As it is read, each error is removed from the queue. When all errors have been read, the 
query returns “0, No Error”. If more errors are accumulated than the queue can hold, the last error in 
the queue is “-350, Too Many Errors”.

[SOURce:]CURRent:RANGe 
This command sets the current range of the electronic load module. There are two current ranges, high 
range (model dependent) and low range (model dependent).  
 
When you program a range value, the load automatically selects the range that corresponds to the 
value that you program. If the value falls in a region where ranges overlap, the electronic load selects 
the range with the highest resolution. 
 
 
NOTE:  When this command is executed, the IMMediate, TRANsient, TRIGgered, and SLEW current 
settings are adjusted as follows. 
 If existing settings are within new range, no adjustment is made.

Measurement Commands 
The signal-oriented measurement commands are used to acquire readings. You can use these high-
level instructions to control the measurement process. 
 
Making Measurements 
The electronic load has the ability to make several types of voltage or current measurements. The 
measurement capabilities of the electronic load are particularly useful with applications that draw 
current in pulses. 
 
All measurements are performed by digitizing the instantaneous input voltage or current for a defined 
number of samples and sample interval, storing the results in a buffer, and then calculating the 
measured result. Many parameters of the measurement are programmable. These include the number 
of samples, the time interval between samples, and the method of triggering. Note that there is a 
tradeoff between these parameters and the speed, accuracy, and stability of the measurement in the 
presence of noise. 
 
There are two ways to make measurements: 
 
1) Use the MEASure commands to immediately start acquiring new voltage or current data, 
and return measurement calculations from this data as soon as the buffer is full. This is the 
easiest way to make measurements, since it requires no explicit trigger programming. 
2) Use an acquisition trigger to acquire the data. Then use the FETCh commands to return 
calculations from the data that was retrieved by the acquisition trigger. This method gives 
you the flexibility to synchronize the data acquisition with a trigger. FETCh commands do 
not trigger the acquisition of new measurement data, but they can be used to return many 
different calculations from the data that was retrieved by the acquisition trigger. 
Making triggered measurements with the acquisition trigger system is discussed in the User Manual. 


---- PAGE 66 ----
 
66 
 
NOTE: For each MEASure form of the query, there is a corresponding query that begins with the 
header FETCh. FETCh queries perform the same calculation as their MEASure counterparts, but do not 
cause new data to be acquired. Data acquired by an explicit trigger or a previously programmed 
MEASure command are used. 
 
 
:FETCh:VOLTage? 
:FETCh:CURRent? 
:FETCh:POWer[:DC]? 
 
These query commands request the latest post-processed readings stored in the sample buffer. After 
sending this command and addressing the electronic load to talk, the readings are sent to the 
computer. This command does not affect the instrument setup. This command does not trigger source-
measure operations; it simply requests the last available readings. Note that this command can 
repeatedly return the same readings. Until there are new readings, this command continues to return 
the old readings.  
 
For example, assume that the electronic load performed 20 measure operations. The :FETCh:VOLTage? 
command will request the readings for those 20 measure operations. If :FETCh:VOLTage? is sent while 
performing measure operations (ARM annunciator on), it will not be executed until the electronic load 
goes back to the idle state. 
 
 
:MEASure:VOLTage[:DC]? 
:MEASure:CURRent[:DC]? 
These commands combine other signal-oriented measurement commands to perform a “one-shot” 
measurement and acquire the reading. Note that if a function is not specified, the measurement will 
be done on the function that is presently selected. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sense Commands 
The Sense subsystem is used to configure and control the measurement functions of the electronic 
load. A function does not have to be selected before you program its various configurations. A function 
can be selected any time after it has been programmed. Whenever a programmed function is selected, 
it assumes the programmed states.

SENSe:AVERage:COUNt 
The command is used to specify the filter count. In general, the filter count is the number of readings 
that are acquired and stored in the filter buffer for the averaging calculation. The larger the filter 
count, the more filtering that is performed.
